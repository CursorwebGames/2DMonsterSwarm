# Lore
The lore technically won't be explained, and the players are left to find themselves.

You are living in a very very poor village ransacked by monsters. You first go to the nearest safe place, which is the swamp. There are many slimes there which you can kill. There is a hermit which sells you the keys to the ocean castle. The ocean castle contains sharks and treasure, and you can use it to get the Lava Hammer. The Lava Hammer can be used to break the doors of the Volcanic Ruins, where you defeat the dragon...

## Dragon
The dragon is the source of all the evil, and killing it means your village is freed!

## Swamp
Once a prosperous empire, it was built on a river bed and collapsed. Many of the inhabitants died, but there is a hermit.

## Ocean Castle
A rival empire to the swamp empire, this one was flooded but the inhabitants evolved and created a prosperous underwater kingdom. However, evil creatures emerged from the dragon and killed them off.

## Volcanic Ruins
The dragon emerged from a gigantic mountain when it erupted. Everything was burned and the dragon began its rein of terror. The ocean castle empire collapsed, and monsters began ransacking the last village of the humans.
